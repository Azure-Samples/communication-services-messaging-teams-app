# B2C Customer-Agent Messaging Teams App

## Overview

This is a sample application to show how we can build a custom [Teams App](https://docs.microsoft.com/microsoftteams/platform/overview#build-apps-with-microsoft-teams-platform) that can interface with an Azure Communication Services instance, enabling the two systems to work together while keeping their backend environments and identity configurations separate.

This sample includes three standalone applications: CustomerApp, BusinessApp, and Server. Together, they provide a comprehensive customer support experience. The overall view of the system is shown below:
<img src="./Assets/architecture-diagram.png" alt="Architecture Diagram" width="1024">

1. An Azure Communication Services instance that enables the chat experience.
2. **CustomerApp**: A web application used by customers to interact with agents. Users of this CustomerApp will be assigned Azure Communication Services identities.
3. **BusinessApp**: A web application hosted within a custom Teams application and deployed to Teams through an iframe inside the Teams client. Agents utilize this app within their Teams client.
   - This app leverages Teamsâ€™ Single Sign-On (SSO) to retrieve the Teams user ID.
   - The Azure Communication Services instance is not directly connected to the Teams environment. [Identity mapping](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/communication-services/concepts/identity-model#user-identity--mapping) is required to connect the BusinessApp users who have a Teams user ID, to the CustomerApp users' Azure Communication Services identities.
   - For this sample app, an Azure Communication Services identity needs to be manually created for each BusinessApp user, then store the identity mapping in the environment variables ([steps are shown below in the AgentUsers section](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/communication-services-messaging-teams-app?tab=readme-ov-file#before-running-the-sample-for-the-first-time)).
   - Once the linkage is set, the BusinessApp will use the Teams user ID to map to the Azure Communication Services ID, then use that ID to retrieve threads and communicate with CustomerApp users.
4. **Azure Cloud**: Where the CustomerApp and the BusinessApp are hosted.
5. **Server** app: A web API that provides the necessary server-side functionality for the BusinessApp and the CustomerApp.
6. **Database**: An Azure Cosmos database to store metadata related to chat threads, such as their status.

## Key Features

<img src="./Assets/feature-demo.png" alt="Feature Demo" width="1024">

- **Seamless Chat Start**: Customers can easily initiate a conversation by entering their name and question, instantly connecting with a random available agent.
- **Integrated Agent Interface**: Agents manage and respond to customer messages directly within the Microsoft Teams environment.
- **Effortless Conversation Management**: Agents can handle multiple customer conversations simultaneously and resolve them when complete. Resolved chats are moved to a separate tab, and customers are notified that the conversation has ended.
- **Chat Continuity**: Customers can resume conversations at any time simply by sending a new message, reactivating the chat.
- **Easy Exit for Customers**: Customers can exit the chat anytime, which revokes their access and informs the agent of their departure. Agents are instantly notified with a toast message showing which customer has exited, keeping them informed in real-time.
